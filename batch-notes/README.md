# AWS Batch Related Notes

## Batch Env JSON dumps

Currently, just JSON AWS CLI "describes" of AWS Batch resources
created with AWS wizards to use for Q&A if needed when creating future
environments.  Just docmentation,  don't think these can be used
as-is to rebuild the env.

## Airflow Prototyping

Incomplete prototyping with Airflow for AWS Batch based on development
version of Airflow.
